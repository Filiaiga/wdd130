                <p>Maloeleilei! I am Asinate Filiaga and I am from Southern California residing in Texas. My roots are from the Island of Tonga. I love playing the piano and doing things with my family. I moved from Southern California about two years ago. I love adventuring and being out with my family. I have two kids and come from a family of 6 chlidren. I love my faith and am a member of The Church Of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saiints. Down below are links to my favorite temples. I love temples because it unites famliies together forever by making promises with God. My picture with my husband was taken at a temple while on a trip to Hawaii. This temple is called the Lai'e Hawaii Temple.  </p>

                <p>Texas is in the Southern North American across the Gulf of Mexico. It is close to Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. It is known as the Lone Star State because the Republic of Texas declared itself as an independent nation. Because of this, the Texas flag has a single star also known as the lone star. It is the second most largest state in the country. </p>
